Filter out: -v  		
  grep -v kali

Print only the match (the trick with this is using regex): -o		
  grep ‐o 'http://[^"]*'  (you can also use double quotes: " to delimit the expression)

Ignore Regex: -F
  grep -F .sh

Cat the whole file highlighting the matches:
  grep --color -E 'pattern|$' file

  #Similar results with:
    less -p pattern file

Does it have any of the lines present in "filter.txt?":
  grep -f filter.txt

Filter out blank lines:
  grep -v '^$' input.txt > output.txt
