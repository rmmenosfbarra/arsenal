Place here all interesting Python libraries & snippets geared towards offensive python scripting (e.g. `python -c "print 'f*ck you'"`).

If you are going to insert snippets heavily based on a specific library, put them in a folder for that library. If it is just a generic python snippet, either create a category (another folder), or save them in the ***offensive-python*** root directory.

If you want to simply mention a library you used, add it to the list with a short description. Should you need to add more information, add a section header in the README or do whatever you feel is the best.

# Libraries
* pwntools https://docs.pwntools.com/en/stable/: Quite CTF oriented
* Twisted (https://github.com/twisted/twisted): [UNTESTED]. Mostly network protocolsÂ´ clients and servers. E.g., you can easily set up a DNS poisoner with it. See here https://gist.github.com/anonymous/ea292c8dc60a2d8fba50 (comes from this challenge: https://github.com/ctfs/write-ups-2014/tree/master/plaid-ctf-2014/whatscat)
